## Turners Car Insurance

### The Client

Turners Car Auctions is a market leader in the automotive industry in New Zealand, responsible for more than 10% of all used vehicle sales in the country. It has retained its original function as a vehicle auctioneer, operating in 19 branches nationwide, but has become increasingly dependent on a parallel role as a conventional used vehicle dealership. In support of that role, it has established in-house finance and vehicle insurance divisions that allow it to offer buyers a complete “one-stop shop” experience.

### The Project Brief

Turners is currently undertaking a major re-design of its motor vehicle insurance systems and processes, including an investigation of ways in which the introduction of new technologies can enhance the buyer experience. Here is some information about motor vehicle insurance at [Turners](https://www.turners.co.nz/Cars/finance-insurance/car-insurance/).  You have just been assigned to the project team to help create a new insurance buying experience.

### Prototype to Showcase AI Solution

The digital team at Turners would like to prototype a solution that allows a user to upload the picture of a car and then identify the type of vehicle, with the aim of calculating appropriate insurance premium for the customer based on the car type.  Your task is to build a cloud-based application that can recognise motor vehicles types (e.g. sedan vs SUV vs truck, or if you want a challenge, try to make your application recognise a few brands and/or models) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure (or AWS or Google Cloud).  You do NOT need to build the function that calculate premium.  You can use code from tutorials you find online, but make sure you read through the code so that you understand the code. 

AWS, Azure and Goggle Cloud all offer free credit for first time user that will be sufficient to complete all Missions.  Regardless of the cloud platform you choose, please make sure you use free credits for the Missions.  Any expense you incur on any cloud platforms will be your own responsibility.
