# Mission 1 Readme

Car Finder is a simple and powerful tool that helps you detect cars in images with ease. Whether you're curious about a vehicle in a photo, working on a car-related project or looking to find a car for personal or business use, our tool makes it quick and hassle-free. Just upload an image, and we'll analyze it to identify the cars present.

## Installation

I used Azure.
I set up an Azure account and created a resource group to manage my application.
I used the Azure App Service which is ideal for web apps with backend services.
I then used the Azure Portal to manually upload pictures of cars to compare against trucks, sedans and SUV's.

## More Details

My project is a React + Vite application integrated with a Bootstap-powered front-end for a car finder tool.
My App.jsx file contains a simple counter example from the default Vite template.
This can be modified to integrate the car detection functionality.
My index.html serves as the main landing page.
It includes a form to upload an image and a section to display the results.
Bootstrap is used for styling and responsive design.
/src/main.js processes the image upload and displays the results.
The Azure App Service I used handles the image uploads, runs detection algorithms and returns the results to the front end.
